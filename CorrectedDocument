//ERROR 1
//The first line of the error message is " Uncaught TypeError: guessSubmit.addEventListener is not a function numberGame.html:86:15 "
//The first part, " Uncaugth TyperError; guessSubmit.addeventListener is not a function ", is telling us something about what went wrong
//The second Part, " numberGame.html:86:15 ", is telling us where in the code the error came from: line 86, character 15 of the file "numberGame.html"
//The error message is telling us that the function we're calling is not recognized by the JavaScript interpreter. Often, this error message actually means we've spelled something wrong. If you are eevr unsure of teh correct spelling of something, look it up using MDN.
//So, based off the error message and the function's name we are calling, it is safe to say we spelled the funnction incorrectly!

//ERROR 2
//After saving the page and refreshing, no more errors were displaying
//Now if we try and enter a number and press Submit, a new error occurs
//The new error in Firefox is " Uncaught TypeError: can't access property "textContent", lowOrHi is null
//The new error in Chrome is " Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set properties of null (setting 'textContext')
//It is the same error, but different browsers display them in different ways
//NOTE: This error didn't come up as soon as the page was loaded because this error occurred inside a function (inside the checkGuess() {} block). Code inside functions runs in a separate scope than code outside functions. In this case, the code was not run and the error was not thrown until the checkGuess() function was run by line 86.
//The line number given in the error is 80. Have a look at line 80, and you'll see the following code: " lowOrHi.textContext = "Last guess was too high!"; "
//This line is trying to se the textContext property of the lowOrHi variable to a text string, but it's not working because lowOrHi does not contain what it's supposed to. Let's see why this is- try searching for other instances of lowOrHi in the code. The earliest instance you'll find is on line 49: " const lowOrHi = document.querySelector("lowOrHi");
//At this point we are trying to make the variable contain a reference to an element in the document's HTML. Let's see what the variable contains after this line has been run. Add teh folowing code on line 50: "console.log(lowOrHi);
//This code will print the value of lowOrHi to the console after we tried to set it in line 49. Save & refresh!
//Sure enough, the value of lowOrHi returns " null ". The value null menas "nothing", or "no value'. So our code to set lowOrHi to an element is going wrong.
//Line 49 is using document.querySelector() method to get a reference to an element by selecting it with a CSS selector. Looking further up our file, we can find the paragraph in question: "<p class="lowOrHi"></p>
//So we need a class selector here, which begins with a dot (.), but the selector being passed into the querySelector() method in line 49 has no dot. This could be the problem! Try changing lowOrHi to .lowOrHi in line 49.
//After refreshing we can see the console.log(lowOrHi) now returns the value of the <p> element we want!
